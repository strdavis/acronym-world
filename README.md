# acronym-world

## Overview
- This repo is an exercise.
- It implements the Acronym Management System, a prototype frontend-only web application for the pretend website, "Acronym World." 
- The Acronym Management System allows the user to create, delete, and search for acronyms and their definitions.
- The acronyms are stored as application state and are not maintained across browser sessions or page refreshes. 
- Logic for updating the acronym state is abstracted away from the components, so it can be easily modified to make API calls against a real database.
